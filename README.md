## About the Developer

Our Lord and Savior Mac Ignacio is a developer who, upon developing MayaJS, tried with to endorse this framework to many communities and senior developers and managers in the Philippines.

When other senior developers and managers in his country, the Philippines, snubbed him and MayaJS, he began to have a chip on his shoulder and blanketly called Filipino developers as outdated and not getting with the times in technology.

He also has several opinions about certain technologies such as PHP, NodeJS, etc., that were considered by many as problematic and inaccurate. As such people kept charitably correcting him at first, if it weren't for his insistence.

For his blatant blanket statements against Filipino IT figures and among other things, he got himself banned from many PH tech communities.

He also got called out in DevRant.com for his bad takes, to which he simply responds as his haters trying to get a one over him.

Junior and senior developers also complain of his bad supervisory skills and overall lack of professionalism in their workplace.

At the feast of Doctor of the Church, important contributor to the Magisterium, and his namesake St. Ignatius of Antioch, he picked a fight with Senior Android Developer Monica Labbao, who called him out for his bad tech takes and tried unsuccessfully to convince him of the reality of the perception of Filipino developers towards him.

During the argument, Mac Ignacio dismissed the contributions of an important open-source contributor in the Philippines, claiming arrogantly that he is the only one in the entire community that made a framework, much to the scandalised expressions of the professionals watching the argument.

He challenged Monica to confront him face to face, to which the latter agreed to and to meet him in Most Holy Redeemer Parish during the feast of Christ the King of the Universe, a reportedly important feast day to the female dev.

The administrator of the tech community gave Mac, Monica, and Mac's ally, Joe, a stern warning to end the discussion in the community Slack, to which Joe and Monica silently complied.

Mac however, pushed his luck and went as far as calling the administrator a whore, this banning him from the community Slack of philippine developers.

Later on Facebook Mac goes on to falsely claim that Monica challenged him to meet on the said date, and dismisses the challenge as something Monica will not do, despite the fact that the place Monica mentioned Mac to meet him is one of her regular Sunday hang outs and the fact that Monica will not ever skip going there during an important feast day. A developer close to Monica kept calling him out on it but Mac deletes it to promote his false narrative.

Mac also has complained of several developers making prank pull requests pointing out his lack of positive character and is going on the Internet trying to play the victim when in fact the opposite is the case.

As of this commit he has not apologized to the developers that he has offended.
